Almost every quiz or test I have taken has had poorly written questions, questions that don't align with material in slides, and trick questions that don't help the students learn.. Poorly written questions.. I did my best to try and figure out the information I am actually supposed to know.. Still just the questions.."
negative,"😰Anxious. I have been struggling with the work load conflicting with work from other courses as well as my job and other responsibilities at home. I believe that I can do well in the course, I just need to allocate my time better. This will be easier in the coming weeks as one of my other courses is ending soon. . Learning python at a quick rate, as I had no experience with it coming in to the course. . I have been trying to allocate my time better. . Finding time to complete all of the work. ."
