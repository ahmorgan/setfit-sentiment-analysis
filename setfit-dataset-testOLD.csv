positive,"😊Satisfied. Having accumulated a delay in my assignments and quizzes, I am working to get back on track. However, as I catch up, I am satisfied to understand better and better.. As I mentioned, my big challenge was catching up on the backlog. Also, committing and pushing the Git module.. I was able to overcome this by reviewing the course notes and asking for clarifications from the TAs.. No.."
positive,"😊Satisfied,😐Neutral (No strong positive or negative emotions). The coding hasn't been too hard. Not too heavy workload. . Learning how to use git hub correctly. Setting an SSH key was tricky.. I watched the videos provided they were great help. . I'm nervous to set up MySql."
negative,"😰Anxious. I have not been catching up with assignments.. Understanding git. I have joined office hours and made time to understand the materials.. Currently, I'm just trying to catch up.."
negative,"😖Frustrated. I've personally had a hard time adjusting to the schedule of the course so far, but it has nothing to do with the quality of the class. Getting Assignment 1 finished. Going through the notes and module information, especially the github tutorial . Getting back on schedule so I can stop turning in work late. I would like to use the Assignment 2 extension to help do this.."
positive,😊Satisfied. I selected satisfied because the work load has been good and not too much.. the biggest challenge was creating the logic for displaying the sandwich menu.. I overcame this challenge by looking at youtube videos and python crash courses. my current challenge right now is learning and getting used to all the git commands.
positive,😍Excited. na. na. na. na.
positive,😍Excited. It seems so interesting.. Nothing really. I didn't. Not really feel super comfortable.
negative,😟Confused. The course content is a little confusing.. Coding in a new language . Watching YouTube videos . Coding is the only difficulty right now..
negative,"😐Neutral (No strong positive or negative emotions). I think I'm just going through the motions in the class at this point. That usually doesn't happen until later in the semester for most of my courses. Although there are some similarities will all the coding languages I've learned up to this point, I'm feeling more frustrated with trying to learn Python because of the similarities it has to Java but also because of all of the differences as well. I understand what is supposed to be happening, and in my brain certain things should work if I put the right words in, but that's not always the case. . Trying to debug the code I wrote. I know that spacing is important in Python, I just didn't realize how many issues it would cause. There was a tab I was missing somewhere and the IDE suggested that I create a class that was already created. Turns out I just needed to insert a tab and everything was working fine. . It took a while for me to figure out why I was getting an error. The first thought was not for me to check the spacing because all the words were correct. I thought maybe there was an issue with me forgetting to save the updated code, or maybe even an issue with potentially not having the latest version of PyCharm. I don't even know why I decided to hit tab, but I'm glad I did. . I'm finding it hard to remain interested in the material that is being presented. It seems a bit dull. This is probably because the more we learn, the more I realize that I am not interested in being a software engineer or developer. ."
negative,😖Frustrated. Frustrated because I had personal issues going on past couple of weeks and missed a few assignments.. Being able to keep up with lectures and assignments in general with personal issues going on.. I resolved my issues and am going to be more organized about class periods and due dates.. Catching up and making sure that I complete the rest of all assignments..
positive,😊Satisfied. The course has been straightforward so far.. I haven't had any challenges.. I haven't had any challenges.. I don't currently have any challenges..
negative,"😖Frustrated,😟Confused,😰Anxious. I have had a tough time understanding a lot of the concepts and have had a hard time completing assignments because of this.. Just understadning some of the concepts.. I have signed up for tutoring so hopefully this will help.. Yes, the concepts over the last few modules have been challenging and confusing for me.."
positive,😍Excited. its very interesting and I live the course . nothing so far . nothing I didn't face challenges . nope .
positive,😊Satisfied. So far it seems like we've been learning some important things for the field as well as things I'm interested in.. None so far. None. Don't currently have any challenges.
negative,"😟Confused,😰Anxious. I was just a bit confused with the assignment. learning to code in python.. still keeping to code and understand better.. just as mentioned before learning to code more in Python.."
negative,😟Confused. Im super confused on using gitlab and gitbash. GitLab and git merging . I have been using youtube and stackoverflow but I will have to attend an office hours. Just that so far.
negative,"😟Confused,😐Neutral (No strong positive or negative emotions). I am a bit concerned about the complexity of future assignments. Currently, I have some understanding of Python, but I am worried about how our assignments or project will become more complex once we start working with MySQL.. It was the first project, I had a lot of difficulty getting github to work.. To overcome that challenge I forgot to register my email on git.. Currently understanding calling objects in python. For the assignment, I struggled a little bit getting everything to work.."
negative,😰Anxious. I am afraid things are going to get progressively harder.. Amount of information I have to read and understand.. By reading a lot and patience.. None..
positive,😍Excited. looking forward to building programs in a team setting at a level of complexity I haven't done in a group before.. syntax. stack overflow and w3 schools being excellent resources for checking syntax and understanding language functionality.. none as of writing.
negative,"😊Satisfied,😟Confused,😰Anxious. I am engaged with the course but the material is difficult so I am just hoping I can stay on top of it.. Learning python and having to code higher level with it has been really difficult and time consuming. I have been trying to look up as much python practice as possible.. Just learning python so far has been difficult. ."
negative,😰Anxious. I'm feeling anxious because I am learning a new language and this is a language that I am learning in another class but I don't want to start mixing up things. . I think right now my problem is the terminology . I am going through all the slides and writing down the terms that I am not comfortable with and writing in a notebook . Same as above.
positive,"😍Excited,😊Satisfied. The instructions to assignments have been very clear and easy to follow. Online resources have been a huge help as well.. The time frame. I feel ive been turning assignments in at the last second.. I have been getting started earlier.. No."
positive,"😍Excited,😊Satisfied. It's putting the things we have learned from past classes and combining them together, learning more about the actual industry. Also python > java. getting sql working correctly on my laptop.. just ran in to it, so this weekend I am going to uninstall everything sql related and reinstall. I think somethig got messed up in some sort of config file.. none so far.."
negative,"😟Confused,😰Anxious. Anxious only because I feel like I understand what I am doing until I don't, then starts falling behind with the knowledge and trying to keep up as new assignments come in.. Git pushing and conventional commit.

Using git and github.. A lot of research. Going to start staying in contact with the TAs.. Git pushing and conventional commit.

Using git and github.."
negative,"😐Neutral (No strong positive or negative emotions). Ive been rather missing on certain topics and need to get my act together.. For some reason, my software has been an issue in keeping my work together.. Bug fixing mainly. N/a."
positive,😊Satisfied. I feel satisifed with the course.. Assignment 1 was pretty challenging for me because I have never used GitHub before.. I watched some videos on how to navigate around GitHub.. Not currently..
positive,😊Satisfied. I am satisfied with the pace and content of the course.. Remembering to format my commit messages on git correctly was my biggest challenge.. I had to learn how to reset git commits to rewrite my commit messages.. I don't have any current challenges..
positive,😊Satisfied. im learning a lot about github while turning in these assignments. The assignments are giving me some good practice. . i dont use github much so its a little scary submitting my assignments because i fear that I'm working hard on the assignments but messing up the submission process. . watching youtube videos . n/a.
negative,😟Confused. This class is my first time using github and I am unsure that I am using it correctly for my assignments.. The biggest challenge for these past modules has been the use of python. . I am still trying to go over the material in regards to python to get a better understanding of how to use it.. A current challenge it this course is grasping git and github. I am trying to understand how to use it correctly for assignments..
positive,"😊Satisfied. The course has been relatively easy to follow and manage thus far.. My biggest challenge so far has been getting used to using Python, but even that hasn't been very difficult.. I used resources like the ones provided by the class and other online sources (w3schools, geeksforgeeks, etc.) to improve my knowledge on the Python programming language.. NA."
positive,😊Satisfied. I selected this choice because I feel like I'm going about alright. The biggest challenge so far has been github. Ive overcome these challenges by asking for help and looking things up. The only challenges that I have currently are with github commits.
positive,😊Satisfied. Applying the information I've learned with our quizzes and homework assignments has helped me stay on track. . None so far.. Haven't had any issues. . I do not have any current challenges. .
positive,"😍Excited. I have liked so far using git. Although it can be a bit challenging, I am having a lot of fun. Using git to push my code. I looked into a bunch of forums surrounding git. I am currently trying to figure out if you can make a repository using git."
positive,"😊Satisfied. I am enjoying this class so far, GitHub is just a little difficult to troubleshoot sometimes.. Working with Git and GitHub. I watched a lot of YouTube tutorials, and tutorials posted by the TAs. Not content-wise, no.."
positive,"😍Excited. From the start, this course has many things that I want to learn and I'm learning a lot of new stuff so I'm really excited about the future concepts and projects. Nothing much but I did suffer a bit for doing commits in the GitHub. started going over again and took some help. Not like really hard stuff but I want to do revision from the start."
positive,😊Satisfied. I have learned quite a bit so far.. My biggest challenge was the sandwich maker. I overcame this by reviewing notes. None at the moment.
positive,😊Satisfied. I am satisfied with the course because I want to learn more about data knowledge and how to implement different tools such as SQL for my future to learn data science. Git version control. I watched youtube videos and referred to one of my friends. Nope.
negative,"😖Frustrated,😟Confused. This class got super hard all of a sudden, assignment one took me many hours.. Assignment one was a lot of work and using GitHub for the first time was challenging.. After plenty of Google searches, reviewing class resources, and the TA's video I figured it out.. I am still learning Python syntax and it is quite challenging.."
positive,"😍Excited. Excited to learn more about the coursework.. Understanding how to get certain things to work for the sandwich maker assignments.. Looking at different resources to understand more concepts.. Learning new material can take some time, but this is to be expected.."
positive,😊Satisfied. going good so far. git and getting my project to transfer over. help with ta and videos. nah.
positive,"😊Satisfied. The content in this class is not too challenging so far, and I feel like I am learning a lot. . The sandwich maker was a little tough on some parts. I took a break, and then came back to it later. With a clearer mind, it was not very hard. . Not currently."
negative,"😊Satisfied,😖Frustrated. Assignments/quiz are okay to work on but my issue is regarding GitHub. . Github. I am still working on it to understand how to generate link on GitHub.. Github."
negative,"😊Satisfied,😰Anxious. Just dont feel confident.. Remembering Python Syntax.. I just kept trying.. N/A."
positive,😊Satisfied. I feel like I am learning a lot from our lectures and assignments so far. I still feel like I have room to grow and master some of the subjects being taught. I struggled a fair amount with the github portion of assignment 1. I found the video that the TA made to be very helpful and it was the main reason I was able to complete that portion of the assignment. . I am currently working on assignment 2 and trying to implement all of the classes. .
negative,"😟Confused. can't figure out how to push file to git respiratory. nothing, just github. Wish the instructions were more clear about uploading the files using terminal. Not yet. can't find the solution. NA."

positive,"😊Satisfied. I overall feel pretty good about the course.. Learning Github. Looking up tutorials, or even using the tutorial that Connor posted last week.. N/a."
positive,"😊Satisfied. The content of the course is interesting.. Pushing to github.. Help from the TAs, learned how to force push.. Not at the moment.."
negative,"😖Frustrated,😟Confused. I genuinely have no idea what I am doing at some points. learning python really since I've only used java. well Im practicing for one. ."
positive,😊Satisfied. It's a decent class.. N/A. N/A. No..
negative,"😟Confused,😰Anxious,😐Neutral (No strong positive or negative emotions). I am not a fan of github nor am i familiar with it so its just a bit confusing to use and have to figure out ontop of everything else im trying to figure out. but trying to take things day by day. the github set up . joins office hours and tried to get some help . github still. trying to figure everything out, and asking questions with TAs."
negative,"😖Frustrated,😟Confused. really slow and github is annoying to use so far. github. lots of videos. github."
positive,😊Satisfied. I feel comfortable so far I just have some questions.. Adjusting the assignments to the pycharm.. TA hours. N/A.
positive,"😊Satisfied. I like the environment of the class. The way the teacher explains it is perfect.  I am very excited to learn more about the work environment aspect of software engineering.  . My biggest challenge some times is understanding Python concepts.. I just took time to practice python and understand the topics.. No not really, just enjoying the class as it goes. ."
positive,😊Satisfied. I feel like we have learned some things that are going to be relevant in the real world. I would like to get to group projects soon.. The ham sandwich maker just took a lot more time than I expected it would.. Just ended up having to stay up later than I thought. I will plan for more time for this classes projects in the future.. no.
positive,😍Excited. It is useful to finally learn git and github and how to apply it.. Learning git.. I used my resources and took advantage of chatgpt and the internet to help me use git.. No.
